# About FOBOH

We are building AI Agents for food and beverage wholesale and distribution

We partner with food and beverage manufacturers and distributors to optimise cost-to-serve by deploying AI employees trained to handle tasks that are currently labour-intensive and prone to error. 
Our first AI Agent (Employee) is a Foodservice order management agent.

- Be human, be you, be awesome
- Take the scenic route
- Radical honesty delivered with kindness
- Create with intention
- Strive for equilibrium in our ecosystem
- Three is better than two, two is better than one
